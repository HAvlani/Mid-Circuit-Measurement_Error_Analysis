This repo contains the code and paper for my science fair project: Analyzing the Effect of Mid-Circuit Measurement on Spectator Qubits

Abstract:
Mid-Circuit Measurements (MCMs) are a key component in many quantum information algorithms. As such, ways to characterize their performance are of great interest. Specifically, it is important to determine what impact MCM has on nearby, unmeasured, spectator qubits. Here, I present a novel benchmarking analysis consisting of a variation of the Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking Technique. I use this method to evaluate MCM-induced spectator qubit error on various qubits inside IBM’s quantum computer “ibm_oslo”. I then examine the effect of qubit position on this error, test if IBM’s widely-used quantum simulators account for this error, see how this error varies across different quantum computers, and posit potential causes of this error. This project has far reaching implications as it helps us beter understand a gate that will be integral to the advancement of quantum computing and discovers a deficiency with current IBM quantum simulators.
